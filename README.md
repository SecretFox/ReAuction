# ReAuction
This mod main purpose is to save all search parameters when you search for an item.  
This includes item type, sub type, quality, stack size,keywords, and checkbox selections, additionally it also saves the sorting column and sorting order.  
It also adds "CLEAR" button that will reset all fields except for "Item Type".  
You can unselect the checkbox "Save all parameters" to only save the item type,this will also hide the added button, however sorting order is still kept.
