# ReAuction
This mod saves all search parameters for the auction house when you search for an item, and inputs them the next time you open it.  
Hitting the CLEAR button will reset all fields except for "Item Type".  

**Note**
By default all values are saved, but you can choose to only save the "Item Type" by using `/option Auction_TypeOnly true` chat command.  
When "TypeOnly" is enabled CLEAR button will be hidden.  

Installation: Unzip to "..\Secret World Legends\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\" folder.
